= What It Does =
================
This asset will process all of your raw Mana Seed Character Base graphics files and turn them into master sheets, thus vastly reducing your overall file count.

==============
= How to Use =
==============

1) Take all of your unzipped Mana Seed folders such as 0bot, 1out, 2clo, etc. as well as the base skin files such as char_a_0bas_humn_v01 and place them in the input folder of Mana Seed Tools.

2) The next step depends on if you're using an asset like my Mana Seed Shaders for Unity. So we'll break it up into 2 parts.
-2a) FOR MANA SEED SHADERS FOR UNITY USERS
Run process_textures in the Mana Seed Tools folder. DO NOT RUN PROCESS_ALL_TEXTURES! We do this because process_all_textures will process all the v02, v03, etc. files that Mana Seed Shaders for Unity doesn't need and ultimately you likely won't use.
-2b) FOR OTHER MANA SEED USERS
Run process_all_textures in the Mana Seed Tools folder. DO NOT RUN PROCESS_TEXTURES!

3) Wait for the process to complete. Any errors will be displayed in RED, and files that weren't found will be ignored and shown in YELLOW.
4) Profit, that's it really. All of your newly packed spritesheets can be found in the output folder. Enoy and best of luck!

Q: Does the packer work for the Mana Seed NPCs?
A: No, it doesn't work with anything but the base.

Q: Can I use the packer to pack other graphics files?
A: No, it is specifically configured for the Mana Seed Character Base.

Q: I have used my own naming system and renamed some of the graphics files for the Character Base, will this still work?
A: No. It relies on the raw, unadultered, unzipped graphics files from the Character Base. I recommend you let it do it's thing, and then you can rename your files however you like.
